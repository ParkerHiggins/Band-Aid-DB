# Band-Aid-DB
Project for CS 348

An application nurses and doctors to access a patient's records and medical history.

Built for Purdue CS 348.

Structure:
This project is built with Angular, Node.js, Express, Sequelize, JWT, and MySQL.

Setup:
After installing required node modules, a database connection needs to be established. This can be done in app/config/db.config.js You also need to create a secret key for token authorization in app/config/auth.config.js.

Once these steps have been completed you should have a functioning build that can be activated by calling "node server.js" for the backend and "ng serve --port 8081" for the front-end.

Access the website at "http://localhost:8081".
